## About

Goober is the greatest thing that happened to CSS-in-JS in years (imo) but the repetitive setup is a bit cumbersome. Thats where Buttered comes into play. Buttered is already set up with the options that most React developers want.

## API

The API is exactly like Goober's, but you don't have to call the setup function.
